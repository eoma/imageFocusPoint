== Description ==

Image focus point is a wordpress plugin that lets
you set the focus point of your picture. It is of particular
use in themes that use cropped versions of a post's or page's featured image.

When a picture is to be cropped, given that a focus point
is set, this plugin will refocus the crop area to your
point of interest in the image.

Usage
-----

After plugin activation, go to the media library and pick an image you will
change the focus point. 

1. Press the "Edit image" button and move your mouse pointer over the image.
You will see a red circle with a black dot in its center in the middle of the picture.
1. Find a point of interest in the picture and click on the spot where you want the focus point.
1. When you're done, click the button marked 'Update media'.

It is of great use together with the [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin when changing themes.
